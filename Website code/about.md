The ATM aims to predict the upcoming round of AFL games using machine learning and sports statistics. All AFL games from 2012 to current along with the in-game statistics are used to train the model. Input variables are obtained by fetching the match line ups for the upcoming games and running exponential decay over each selected players previous 5 games. Other variables such as elo and various form metrics are calculated and weather predictions for the area the game is being played at that time is also fetched. For a full list of collected variables please contact Blake Noske via [email](mailto:blake.noske@gmail.com). the model is refreshed with updated data every Monday to Saturday evening.

The current model being used is an ensemble model made up of a neural network, random forest, and xgboost. The source code for this model can be found on the [github](https://github.com/blake-noske/blake-noske.github.io). Model training and tesing has been performed during the update and factored into the prediction.
